##### Machine Learning for industrial process control.

In this repository we explore predictive quality control using
machine learning in an industrial setting as desribed 
int (TODO: Add paper link here).

The measurements which where used to train and test
the model can be found in the ```01_Data``` folder,
this folder also outlines the meaning of important
keys, floats and constants.

Our Preprocessing code is available in ```02_Preprocessing```.

Finally the folder ```classifier``` contains code to train
and test our models.

The industrial demo setting we consider is
shown in the video below:
